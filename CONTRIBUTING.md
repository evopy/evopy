# Contributing to evopy

First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute! 🎉


## 🐞 Want to report a bug or suggest a feature?

Please consider filing an issue on GitHub!

Before you do, have a look if someone has already filed an issue addressing your concern. 

If there already is such an issue, feel free to comment on the issue to show your support for it, or to add additional information that might be helpful. You can also just react with a thumbs-up 👍 to the issue, to indicate that you'd be interested in its resolution. This can help us prioritize what we spend our development time on.

If you can't find an issue that fits your problem or feature request, open a new one. Describe actual and expected behavior, and be as detailed as you can. We'll get back to you asap.
